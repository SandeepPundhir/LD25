# LD25 - Elevator Evil
You are an evil elevator! Your goal is drop the mans of at the wrong floor so they get stressed out and eventually explode!When the mans realise that they're on the wrong floor they will be damaged by stress. The more stressed out they are, the more damage they take. This is indicated by the number over their head. The further away from the correct floor they are, the more stress they take. If you drop them at the correct floor though, the will be relieved and lose stress.

Made in C# and XNA. Other programs used were Photoshop, Sonar, Audacity, Paint.net and Visual Studio 2010.

This has been my first publicly released game. I hope you enjoy.
